## Background & Significance

The transition from senior high school to college is one of the most consequential decisions a young Filipino will ever make. Yet millions of students face this crossroads with little more than word-of-mouth, outdated printed guides, or scattered information spread across dozens of disconnected websites.

**The problems are real:**

- Students in provincial and rural areas have severely limited access to accurate, up-to-date college information.
- Scholarship opportunities go unclaimed every year simply because students do not know they exist, or cannot navigate the complicated application processes.
- School guidance counselors are severely outnumbered, often managing hundreds of students at once, leaving many without personalized advice.
- Review centers and entrance exam preparation resources are unevenly distributed, disadvantaging students outside Metro Manila.

**Hakbang** (*Filipino for "step"* or *"stride"*) was built to close these gaps. The name reflects the app's core philosophy — every student deserves a clear, guided, and confident step forward into higher education, regardless of geography, socioeconomic background, or access to traditional resources.

By aggregating college discovery, scholarship matching, AI-powered guidance, and review center information into a single mobile platform, Hakbang levels the playing field for Filipino students who would otherwise navigate this journey alone.

## What is Hakbang?

Hakbang is a cross-platform mobile application built with Flutter that serves as a comprehensive college planning assistant. It provides:

- A **searchable, map-enabled directory** of colleges and universities.
- A **curated scholarship database** categorized by government and non-government programs.
- An **AI-powered chat assistant (Gabay)** that answers questions about admissions, entrance exams, scholarships, and career paths.
- A **review center hub** that connects students with test preparation resources filtered by learning modality.
- A **personal profile system** that tracks saved schools, saved scholarships, and user activity.

## State Management

Hakbang uses a lightweight, dependency-free state management approach built entirely on Flutter's built-in `ValueNotifier` and `ValueListenableBuilder`. All shared application state lives in a single file: `lib/notifiers.dart`.

This approach was deliberately chosen to keep the app lean, avoid dependency lock-in, and ensure that any Flutter developer can read and contribute to state logic without learning an external library.

### Global Notifiers

| Notifier | Type | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `userCredentials` | `ValueNotifier<User?>` | Logged-in user's profile data |
| `token` | `ValueNotifier<String?>` | JWT bearer token for authenticated API calls |
| `navigationBarIndex` | `ValueNotifier<int>` | Active bottom navigation tab (default: 2 — Home) |
| `welcomePageIndex` | `ValueNotifier<int>` | Current slide in the onboarding PageView |
| `availableColleges` | `ValueNotifier<List<College>>` | Full college list from API |
| `collegeSection` | `ValueNotifier<List<College>>` | Filtered/displayed college list |
| `availableScholarships` | `ValueNotifier<List<ScholarshipObject>>` | Full scholarship list from API |
| `governmentSection` | `ValueNotifier<List<ScholarshipObject>>` | Government scholarships subset |
| `nonGovernmentSection` | `ValueNotifier<List<ScholarshipObject>>` | Non-government scholarships subset |
| `featuredScholarship` | `ValueNotifier<ScholarshipObject?>` | The top-pick scholarship displayed prominently |
| `availableReviewCenters` | `ValueNotifier<List<ReviewCenter>>` | Full review center list from API |
| `reviewCenterSection` | `ValueNotifier<List<ReviewCenter>>` | Filtered review centers |
| `savedSchools` | `ValueNotifier<List<College>>` | User's personally saved colleges |
| `savedScholarships` | `ValueNotifier<List<ScholarshipObject>>` | User's personally saved scholarships |
| `chatMessages` | `ValueNotifier<List<AiMessage>>` | Gabay AI chat message history |
| `chatLoading` | `ValueNotifier<bool>` | Whether Gabay is waiting for an AI response |
| `activityList` | `ValueNotifier<List<Activity>>` | User activity log, sorted by date |
| `userPosition` | `ValueNotifier<Position?>` | User's current GPS coordinates |
| `selectedSchoolPosition` | `ValueNotifier<LatLng?>` | Map-selected college coordinates |
| `locationEnabled` | `ValueNotifier<bool?>` | Whether device location services are enabled |
| `hasInternetConnection` | `ValueNotifier<bool>` | Current internet connectivity status |
| `agreeToTerms` | `ValueNotifier<bool>` | Terms & conditions checkbox state (signup) |
| `selectedFilter` | `ValueNotifier<List<bool>>` | Active scholarship filter tab |
| `selectedHubFilter` | `ValueNotifier<List<bool>>` | Active review center modality filter |
| `governmentSelected` | `ValueNotifier<bool>` | Which scholarship category tab is active |
| `onSelect` | `ValueNotifier<String>` | Currently selected item identifier |

## Backend & API

Hakbang communicates with two separate hosted backend services, both deployed on **Render**.

### Main API Server
**Base URL:** `https://project-hakbang-server-vif8.onrender.com`

| Method | HTTP | Endpoint | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `userLogin` | `POST` | `/user/login` | Authenticates credentials, returns JWT |
| `createUser` | `POST` | `/user/register` | Creates a new user account |
| `getUserData` | `GET` | `/user/...` | Fetches full user profile |
| `getCollege` | `GET` | `/college/auth/available-colleges` | Returns full college directory |
| `getScholarships` | `GET` | `/scholarship/auth/active-scholarships` | Returns all active scholarships |
| `getHubs` | `GET` | *(hub endpoint)* | Returns review center list |
| `getUserActivities` | `GET` | *(activity endpoint)* | Fetches user activity log |
| `getSavedSchools` | `GET` | *(saved endpoint)* | Fetches user's saved colleges |
| `getSavedScholarships` | `GET` | *(saved endpoint)* | Fetches user's saved scholarships |
| `updateUserAboutMe` | `PATCH` | *(user endpoint)* | Updates user bio |

All authenticated endpoints require:
```
Authorization: Bearer <token>
```

### AI Chat Service
**Base URL:** `https://project-hakbang-server.onrender.com`

| Method | HTTP | Endpoint | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `sendUsermessage` | `POST` | `/chat/auth/message` | Sends a user message and receives an AI response |

The AI chat service is handled by `lib/server/services/ai_chat.dart` and returns plain text responses that are rendered as Markdown in the UI via `flutter_markdown_plus`.

### Network Layer
All HTTP logic is centralized in `lib/server/database/database.dart`. There is no HTTP interceptor abstraction — each method handles its own request, response parsing, and error signaling to keep API calls explicit and traceable.

Internet availability is checked before every login attempt using `lib/functions/internet.dart`, which uses `connectivity_plus` to detect Wi-Fi or mobile data.

## Design System

Hakbang uses a fully custom, centralized design system with a dark theme. All design tokens are defined in `lib/design/` and shared across the entire app — no inline colors or font sizes in widget files.

### Color Palette

The app uses a rich dark theme with a signature **lime accent (`#C8FF4D`)** as the primary brand color.

| Token | Hex | Usage |
|---|---|---|
| `AppColors.bg` | `#0C0D10` | Page backgrounds |
| `AppColors.bodyBg` | `#07080C` | Body/root background |
| `AppColors.surface` | `#13141A` | Cards, bottom nav |
| `AppColors.surface2` | `#1C1E27` | List items, text inputs |
| `AppColors.surface3` | `#23263A` | Inactive states, avatar backgrounds |
| `AppColors.accent` | `#C8FF4D` | Primary brand — buttons, active states |
| `AppColors.onAccent` | `#0C0D10` | Dark text placed on accent color |
| `AppColors.accentLight` | `#D9FE84` | Stat highlights, secondary accents |
| `AppColors.blue` | `#4D8FFF` | Info states, links |
| `AppColors.purple` | `#A855F7` | Scholarship-related UI |
| `AppColors.coral` | `#FF6B4D` | Urgency indicators, deadlines |
| `AppColors.teal` | `#4DFFB8` | Progress, success states |
| `AppColors.border` | `rgba(255,255,255,0.07)` | Subtle dividers |
